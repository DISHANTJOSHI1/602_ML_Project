## Introduction
- Due to confidentiality reasons accessing the original patients data was not possible hence, we are using artificially generated EMR.
- Electronic medical records (EMRs) represent a powerful resource to study disease complications at a population level. 
- Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of EMR analysis for discovering or confirming outcome correlations, subcategories of disease.

## Objective
- To be able to predict the generic diseases from the given primary diagnostic data
- Predicting the age of the patient
- Predicting Lab test type

## What to expect from the code?
- Data collection: using the EMR record
- Describe data 
- Explore data 
- Data Modelling

## Models used
- Kneighbors Classifier
- Linear Regression
- SVM
- XGBoost
